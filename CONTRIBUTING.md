## Coding Standards

To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, please follow these rules:

* **Naming:** Use intuitive function and variable names (e.g., `transfer_credits()` instead of `trf_c()`).
* **Consistency:** Match the existing style and indentation of the project.
* **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic, but aim for code that is self-explanatory.
* **Documentation:** If you add a new feature, update the `README.md` to reflect the changes.
